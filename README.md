 # Project Title : EyeExercise

# Description of Project
this is a project that is ment to demonstrate the ability of javascript to track mouse movment via the "onmousemove" event. each time the event is triggered, the new location is calculated, and the "eye ball" position is changed programiticaly via css position. 

# How to Run: 
download all the files, and open the index.html file in a web browser, move your mouse around the screen and watch as the eye balls magicaly look at your mouse cursor.

# Roadmap of future improvements: 
to improve this in the future I would encapsulate the whole html and css into a class, in this way you could new it up and genorate as many eyes on the screen as you want. each would function indipendantly of eachother.
